Triumph is two related but decoupled pieces, the CRUD Engine and the Base Class.

CRUD Engine
-----------
The CRUD Engine works on array representations of records to provide basic:
 
  C.reate - Adding a new record
  R.ead   - Retrieving an existing record
  U.pdate - Altering an existing record
  D.elete - Deleting an existing record

Data access and manipulation operations.



Base Class
----------
The Base Class is used to provide auto-CRUD capabilities to any class.  It 
leverages the CRUD Engine and provides a clean object oriented interface to it.
